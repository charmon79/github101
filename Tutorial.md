##Getting started

###Clone this repository
```git clone https://github.com/charmon79/github101.git```

This will create the directory `github101` in your current working directory, and pull down all of the files in the repository to that directory.

###Change directory to the cloned repo directory
```cd github101```

###Create a new branch
```git branch foo```

###Switch to new branch "foo"
```git checkout foo```

###Create a new file in the directory
This can be anything you like. I'd recommend a simple text file for now.

###Stage your changes. For now, we'll just stage all changes in the directory to keep the demo simple.
```git add .```
